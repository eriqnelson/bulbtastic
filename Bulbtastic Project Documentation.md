# **Bulbtastic Project Documentation**

## **Overview**

A self-powered, battery-backed smart lightbulb form factor Meshtastic node, combining LoRa mesh communication with a low-power lighting element and Bluetooth setup support. The radio functions independently from the light, powered by a 24-hour battery. Ideal for emergency mesh nodes or passive infrastructure deployments in outdoor/utility settings.

## **Phase 1: Breadboard Prototype**

### **Objectives**

* Validate power management and battery operation for 24+ hours  
* Confirm Meshtastic firmware compatibility with Wio SX1262 \+ XIAO ESP32-S3  
* Test BLE pairing and LED status behavior using a single shared LED  
* Prototype light sensor \+ LED circuit with auto on/off functionality  
* Simulate single AC-DC power source behavior with battery isolation

## **Phase 2: First Article Integration (3D Printed Housing)**

### **Objectives**

* Build fully integrated bulb form factor  
* House all components in a thermal/RF-aware shell  
* Incorporate vertical neck antenna chamber  
* Add USB-C access port for charging/debugging  
* Integrate single-button, single-LED user interface with waterproof design

### **Mechanical Design**

* Edison E26 screw base specified for standard North American light socket compatibility  
* Conductive threading connects only to LED circuit and AC-DC converter input  
* Insulate internal radio/battery system from AC mains using isolated AC-DC module  
* 3D printed shell with three major zones:  
  1. **LED dome** â€” diffused plastic, housing COB LED  
  2. **Neck/stem** â€” vertical antenna chimney and light sensor port  
  3. **Base section** â€” contains battery, PCB, USB-C port, status LED, and membrane button

### **Component Layout for 3D Print**

* **Status LED**: Mounted on the exterior-facing side of the base, visible from below when the bulb is installed in a socket.  
* **Membrane Button**: Located adjacent to the status LED on the base, recessed slightly to prevent accidental presses.  
* **USB-C Port**: Exposed through the base, centered or side-mounted with a structural lip or dust cover for protection.  
* **LDR (Light Sensor)**: Mounted high on the neck/stem section, oriented outward and angled slightly downward. The position should allow it to detect ambient room or porch light without interference from the bulbâ€™s own COB LED.  
* **Vertical Chimney**: Antenna runs up through the neck, thermally and electrically isolated from the LED core, spaced away from copper contacts and aluminum cores.

Internal component mounting plates and channels should be added for:

* Wio board alignment above battery plane  
* Secure anchoring of HLK and TP4056 modules  
* Threaded inserts or press-fit snap points for enclosing base shell  
* Cable routing from AC contacts to converter and from battery section to upper dome  
* Edison E26 screw base specified for standard North American light socket compatibility  
* Conductive threading connects only to LED circuit and AC-DC converter input  
* Insulate internal radio/battery system from AC mains using isolated AC-DC module  
* 3D printed shell with three major zones:  
  1. **LED dome** â€” diffused plastic, housing COB LED  
  2. **Neck/stem** â€” contains wire antenna, BLE button, and status LED  
  3. **Base section** â€” contains battery, PCB, and USB-C port  
* Single waterproof membrane pushbutton mounted in neck  
* Status LED visible through neck


### **Mechanical Notes**

* Use thermally isolated vertical chimney in neck for antenna placement  
* USB-C port exposed in base and recessed for access  
* Vent holes or RF-transparent mesh for airflow

### **Power System Design**

* Single 120V input feeds AC-DC converter  
* 12V rail feeds LED directly and charge controller module  
* Charge controller feeds LiPo battery  
* Battery powers ESP32/LoRa via LDO regulator  
* Lighting circuit fully isolated from radio via battery buffering

### **Final Firmware**

* Use Meshtastic config tuned for low power:  
  * `position_broadcast_secs = 900`  
  * `min_wake = 30`  
  * `max_wake = 300`  
* Enable BLE pairing via long-press  
* Blink LED for heartbeat, transmit, or battery status  
* Button logic:  
  * Short press (â‰¤1 sec): Soft reset system  
  * Long press (3â€“5 sec): Enter Bluetooth pairing mode (flashing blue)  
  * Press and hold \>10 sec: Power off or enter deep sleep
